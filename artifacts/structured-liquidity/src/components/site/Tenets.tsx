          <p>
            Buttons, borders, navigation, footers, body containers, and panels
            form a tactile system through square geometry, obvious controls and
            boundaries, and selective flat shadows.

          <p>
            Motion carries state between navbar actions, menu options, tabs,
            filters, overlays, and page areas without becoming the only carrier
            of meaning.

          <h3>Scientific Modern Clarity</h3>
          <p>
            Information organized through rational grids, disciplined hierarchy,
            measured typography, captions, evidence, and purposeful whitespace.
            Swiss modernism is the informing tradition. Every screen remains
            complete and useful without relying on color, glass, or motion.
